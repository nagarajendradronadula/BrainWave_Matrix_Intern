🚀 Here's a Project Showcase: Brain Wave Matrix - ATM Interface 💳 (Java)

I’m excited to share my recent project built entirely in Java — a fully functional ATM Interface that simulates the core features of an Automated Teller Machine! 🏦


💻 Tech Stack Used:
 • Java (Core Concepts: OOPs, Control Flow, Collections)
 • Java’s Date & Time API (LocalDateTime, DateTimeFormatter)
 • Scanner for user input
 • HashMap for transaction history tracking


🛠️ Features:

✅ Deposit Money – Add funds to your account and view updated balance.
✅ Withdraw Money – Safely withdraw money (with balance validation).
✅ Check Balance – Instantly see your current account balance.
✅ Transaction History – Displays a timestamped log of all deposits and withdrawals.
✅ Looped Interface – Keeps the session running until the user chooses to exit.


📋 How It Works:
 • Upon running the program, users are greeted with a simple console-based menu.
 • Users can choose to Deposit, Withdraw, Check Balance, View Transactions, or Exit.
 • Every transaction is time-stamped and stored using a HashMap for quick and clear transaction tracking.


🔁 The system is interactive and menu-driven, making it beginner-friendly for those new to Java or interested in understanding how basic banking logic works in software systems.


🎯 Why I Built This?
To solidify my understanding of Java fundamentals, user input handling, and collection frameworks while building a project that’s simple, relatable, and practical.


📌 If you’re learning Java and want to work on beginner-friendly, real-world simulations, this kind of project is a great starting point and you can also connect with me!
